libinput (0.9.0+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Support for hovering fingers on touchpads. Some touchpads detect fingers
      before actually touching the surface causing unexpected motion
      events. libinput now handles such touchpads.
    - Click methods are now configurable, see below for more details.
    - Support for the Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd was added. Note that this requires
      kernel patches and a udev hwdb addition, see this post for more details:

libinput (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    + There is no API/ABI stability promise yet, but the API and ABI have
      been mostly stable so far. Since this is only in experimental at this
      point and there are no rdepends, I won't change the library name. That
      will change once there are rdepends or once the library is in unstable.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Updated copyright years.
  * debian/libinput0.symbols:
    + Updated for the new symbols.
